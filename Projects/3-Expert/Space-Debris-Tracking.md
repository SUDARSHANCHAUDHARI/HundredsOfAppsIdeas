# Space Debris Tracking

## Description
An advanced space debris tracking and management system that monitors, predicts, and mitigates space junk threats to satellites and spacecraft using AI-powered radar and optical tracking.

## User Stories
- As a space agency, I want to track and catalog all space debris objects
- As a satellite operator, I want to receive collision avoidance alerts
- As a space researcher, I want to analyze debris patterns and trends
- As a government regulator, I want to enforce space debris mitigation policies
- As a commercial space company, I want to ensure safe satellite deployment

## Bonus Features
- Real-time space debris tracking and cataloging
- AI-powered collision prediction and risk assessment
- Automated collision avoidance maneuver planning
- Space debris removal and cleanup coordination
- Orbital trajectory optimization and simulation
- International space debris data sharing
- Space weather impact analysis
- Satellite constellation management integration
