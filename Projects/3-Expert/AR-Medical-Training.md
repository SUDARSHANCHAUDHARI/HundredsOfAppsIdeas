# AR Medical Training Simulator

## Description
An augmented reality medical training platform that allows healthcare professionals to practice complex procedures in realistic, interactive 3D environments with haptic feedback and AI guidance.

## User Stories
- As a medical student, I want to practice surgeries in AR with realistic anatomy
- As a surgeon, I want to learn new techniques in a risk-free environment
- As an instructor, I want to monitor and guide students in real-time
- As a hospital admin, I want to track training progress and competency
- As a patient, I want to understand procedures through AR visualization

## Bonus Features
- AI-powered performance analysis and feedback
- Haptic feedback integration for realistic sensations
- Multi-user collaborative training sessions
- Real-time anatomy adaptation based on patient data
- Integration with medical imaging (MRI, CT scans)
- Emergency scenario simulations
- Certification and competency tracking
- Remote expert guidance during procedures
