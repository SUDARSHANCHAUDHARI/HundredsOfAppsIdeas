# Machine Learning Model Deployment Platform

## Description
A comprehensive MLOps platform that automates the deployment, monitoring, and management of machine learning models with features like A/B testing, model versioning, and performance tracking.

## User Stories
- As a data scientist, I want to deploy ML models without extensive DevOps knowledge
- As an ML engineer, I want to manage model versions and rollbacks
- As a business user, I want to monitor model performance and business impact
- As a developer, I want to integrate ML models into applications easily
- As a team lead, I want to track model usage and costs

## Bonus Features
- Automated model training and deployment pipelines
- A/B testing framework for model comparison
- Real-time model performance monitoring
- Automated model retraining based on performance degradation
- Integration with popular ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Model explainability and interpretability features
- Cost optimization and resource management
- Multi-cloud deployment support
