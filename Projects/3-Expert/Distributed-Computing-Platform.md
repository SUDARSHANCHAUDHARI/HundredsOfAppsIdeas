# Distributed Computing Platform

## Description
A distributed computing platform that enables users to harness the power of multiple machines for complex computations, with features like load balancing, fault tolerance, and real-time monitoring.

## User Stories
- As a researcher, I want to distribute large computational tasks across multiple machines
- As a developer, I want to build scalable distributed applications
- As a system administrator, I want to monitor and manage distributed resources
- As a data scientist, I want to process big data in parallel
- As a student, I want to learn about distributed systems concepts

## Bonus Features
- Automatic load balancing and task distribution
- Fault tolerance with automatic failover
- Real-time monitoring and performance analytics
- Support for multiple programming languages
- Integration with cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Container orchestration with Docker/Kubernetes
- Distributed file system for data sharing
- Security and encryption for distributed computations
