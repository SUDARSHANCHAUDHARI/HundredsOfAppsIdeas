# Neural Network Visualizer

## Description
An interactive neural network visualization tool that allows users to design, train, and understand deep learning models through real-time visual feedback and educational modules.

## User Stories
- As a student, I want to visualize how neural networks learn and make decisions
- As a researcher, I want to debug and optimize neural network architectures
- As a teacher, I want to demonstrate deep learning concepts interactively
- As a developer, I want to understand model behavior and performance
- As a data scientist, I want to experiment with different architectures

## Bonus Features
- Real-time training visualization with loss and accuracy tracking
- Interactive layer manipulation and architecture design
- Integration with popular ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- 3D visualization of high-dimensional data
- Automated architecture suggestions based on data
- Transfer learning model comparison
- Explainable AI (XAI) features
- Collaborative model development
