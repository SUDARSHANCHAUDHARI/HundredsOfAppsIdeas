# Todo List Manager

**Tier:** 1-Beginner  

A todo list is one of the most practical applications you can build as a beginner.  
In this project, you'll create a **Todo List Manager** that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.  

This project teaches fundamental **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **local storage** — core skills for any web developer.


## Features

- **Add Tasks** – Enter new tasks with a simple input field and button.  
- **Mark Complete** – Click tasks to toggle their completion status.  
- **Edit Tasks** – Modify existing task descriptions inline.  
- **Delete Tasks** – Remove tasks you no longer need.  
- **Persistent Storage** – Tasks are saved in browser's local storage.  
- **Task Counter** – Display total and completed task counts.  
- **Clean UI** – Modern, responsive design with smooth interactions.


## User Stories

- [ ] User can see an **input field** to add new tasks.  
- [ ] User can **add tasks** by typing and pressing Enter or clicking Add button.  
- [ ] User can see **all tasks** displayed in a list format.  
- [ ] User can **mark tasks as complete** by clicking on them (strikethrough effect).  
- [ ] User can **edit existing tasks** by clicking an edit button or double-clicking.  
- [ ] User can **delete tasks** using a delete button next to each task.  
- [ ] User can see a **task counter** showing total and completed tasks.  
- [ ] User's tasks **persist** after browser refresh (local storage).  
- [ ] User can **clear all completed tasks** with a single button.  


## Bonus Features

- **Task Categories** – Organize tasks by categories (Work, Personal, Shopping).  
- **Priority Levels** – Mark tasks as High, Medium, or Low priority.  
- **Due Dates** – Add and display due dates for tasks.  
- **Search/Filter** – Filter tasks by completion status or search by text.  
- **Drag & Drop** – Reorder tasks by dragging them.  
- **Dark Mode** – Toggle between light and dark themes.  
- **Export/Import** – Download tasks as JSON or import from file.  


## Learning Outcomes

- **DOM Manipulation** – Create, read, update, and delete HTML elements
- **Event Handling** – Respond to user clicks, keypresses, and form submissions
- **Local Storage** – Persist data across browser sessions
- **Conditional Rendering** – Show/hide elements based on application state
- **Array Methods** – Use map, filter, and reduce for data manipulation
- **CSS Styling** – Create responsive, modern UI designs
- **Form Validation** – Ensure user input is valid before processing


## Technical Concepts Covered

- HTML5 semantic elements
- CSS Flexbox/Grid layouts
- JavaScript ES6+ features (arrow functions, template literals, destructuring)
- Event delegation and bubbling
- Browser storage APIs
- Responsive design principles
- Component-based thinking

## Getting Started

1. Create the basic HTML structure with semantic tags
2. Style the application with modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid)
3. Implement add, edit, delete functionality
4. Add local storage for data persistence
5. Include bonus features as you progress
6. Test thoroughly and refine the UI/UX


## Next Steps

After completing this project, you'll be ready for:
- More complex data management (CRUD operations)
- Working with external APIs
- Building multi-page applications
- Implementing user authentication
- Advanced state management patterns
