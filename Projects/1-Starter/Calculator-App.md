# Calculator App

**Tier:** 1-Beginner  

A calculator is a classic beginner project that teaches fundamental programming concepts while creating something genuinely useful.  
In this project, you'll build a fully functional **Calculator App** that performs basic arithmetic operations with a clean, intuitive interface.  

This project focuses on **event handling**, **mathematical operations**, and **state management** — essential skills for any interactive application.


## Features

- **Basic Operations** – Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- **Clear Functions** – Clear current entry (C) and clear all (AC).  
- **Decimal Support** – Handle decimal numbers and floating-point arithmetic.  
- **Keyboard Support** – Use keyboard for input and operations.  
- **Error Handling** – Handle division by zero and invalid inputs gracefully.  
- **History Display** – Show current operation and previous result.  
- **Responsive Design** – Works on desktop and mobile devices.  


## User Stories

- [ ] User can see a **display screen** showing current numbers and results.  
- [ ] User can click **number buttons** (0-9) to input numbers.  
- [ ] User can click **operation buttons** (+, -, ×, ÷) to select operations.  
- [ ] User can click **equals button** (=) to calculate the result.  
- [ ] User can click **clear button** (C) to clear current entry.  
- [ ] User can click **all clear button** (AC) to reset the calculator.  
- [ ] User can click **decimal button** (.) to input decimal numbers.  
- [ ] User can use **keyboard** for number and operation input.  
- [ ] User sees **error messages** for invalid operations (like division by zero).  
- [ ] User can see **operation history** in the display.  


## Bonus Features

- **Scientific Functions** – Square root, power, percentage, and memory functions.  
- **Theme Switcher** – Multiple color themes (dark, light, colorful).  
- **Calculation History** – Store and view previous calculations.  
- **Copy Result** – Copy results to clipboard with one click.  
- **Sound Effects** – Add button click sounds for better UX.  
- **Animation Effects** – Smooth transitions and button press animations.  
- **Unit Converter** – Convert between different units (length, weight, temperature).  


## Learning Outcomes

- **Event Handling** – Capture and respond to button clicks and keyboard input
- **State Management** – Track current numbers, operations, and results
- **Mathematical Operations** – Implement arithmetic with proper precedence
- **Error Handling** – Gracefully handle edge cases and invalid inputs
- **DOM Manipulation** – Update display and UI elements dynamically
- **Conditional Logic** – Handle different calculation scenarios
- **User Input Validation** – Ensure inputs are valid before processing


## Technical Concepts Covered

- HTML5 semantic structure
- CSS Grid/Flexbox for button layout
- JavaScript arithmetic operations
- Event listeners and handlers
- String parsing and number conversion
- Error handling and validation
- Responsive design principles
- State management patterns

## Getting Started

1. Create the HTML structure with display and button grid
2. Style the calculator with CSS (use Grid for button layout)
3. Implement basic number input functionality
4. Add arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷)
5. Include clear and equals functionality
6. Add keyboard support and error handling
7. Implement bonus features as you progress


## Implementation Tips

- Use separate variables for current number, previous number, and operation
- Handle decimal points carefully to avoid floating-point precision issues
- Implement proper order of operations for future scientific features
- Use CSS transitions for smooth button press effects
- Test edge cases like division by zero and very large numbers


## Next Steps

After completing this project, you'll be ready for:
- More complex mathematical applications
- Building form-based applications
- Working with more advanced state management
- Creating data visualization tools
- Building business logic-heavy applications
