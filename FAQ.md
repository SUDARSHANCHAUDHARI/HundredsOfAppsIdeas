# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

Got questions about TonsOfIdeasForApps? You're in the right place! Here are answers to the most common questions we get from our community.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Q: I'm completely new to programming. Where should I start?**
**A:** Welcome! Our **Starter** projects are currently in development. In the meantime, we recommend starting with our **Builder** projects if you have basic programming knowledge. If you're completely new, consider learning fundamentals first and then check back soon for our beginner projects!

### **Q: How do I know which skill level is right for me?**
**A:** Here's a quick guide:
- **Starter**: New programmers (coming soon!)
- **Builder**: You've built several apps and are comfortable with APIs, state management, and complex logic
- **Expert**: You're confident with full-stack development, databases, and system architecture

### **Q: Do I need to know a specific programming language?**
**A:** Not necessarily! Most projects can be built with any modern language. We suggest using what you're most comfortable with, or trying something new if you want to expand your skills. JavaScript/Python are great starting points.

## 📚 Project Questions

### **Q: How long does it take to complete a project?**
**A:** It varies widely:
- **Starter projects**: 2-8 hours for most developers (coming soon)
- **Builder projects**: 8-25 hours depending on complexity
- **Expert projects**: 20-100+ hours for full implementations

Remember: Learning takes time, and that's okay!

### **Q: Can I modify the project requirements?**
**A:** Absolutely! These projects are starting points. Feel free to add features, change technologies, or adapt them to your interests. The goal is learning, not rigid adherence to specifications.

### **Q: What if I get stuck on a project?**
**A:** Getting stuck is part of learning! Try these steps:
1. Take a break and come back with fresh eyes
2. Break the problem into smaller pieces
3. Search for specific technical questions online
4. Ask for help in our community discussions
5. Look at the example implementations for guidance

## 🛠️ Technical Questions

### **Q: Do I need to set up a development environment?**
**A:** Yes, you'll need a code editor (like VS Code), a web browser, and the runtime for your chosen language (Node.js, Python interpreter, etc.). Most projects don't require complex setup beyond the basics.

### **Q: Can I use different technologies than suggested?**
**A:** Definitely! The suggested technologies are recommendations, not requirements. If you prefer React over Vue, or Python over JavaScript, go for it. The concepts transfer across technologies.

### **Q: Should I use version control (Git)?**
**A:** We highly recommend it! Git helps you track your progress, collaborate with others, and maintain backup copies of your work. It's a professional skill worth learning early.

## 🎯 Learning & Career

### **Q: Will these projects help me get a job?**
**A:** Yes! These projects are designed to teach skills that employers actually want. Completing several projects gives you a strong portfolio and demonstrates your ability to build real applications.

### **Q: Should I put these projects on my resume?**
**A:** Absolutely! Include 2-3 of your best projects with links to live demos and source code. Focus on projects that showcase the skills relevant to jobs you're applying for.

### **Q: How many projects should I complete?**
**A:** Quality over quantity! It's better to complete 3-4 projects thoroughly than to start 10 and finish none. Aim for a mix of difficulties that showcase your range of skills.

- Check the console for error messages

### **Q: The project seems too hard/easy for me. What should I do?**

### **Q: How do I know if I'm making progress?**
**A:** You're making progress if:
- You understand concepts that confused you before
- You can solve problems independently
